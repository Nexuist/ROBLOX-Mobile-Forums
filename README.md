### Introduction

As a pre-teen, one of my favorite games was [ROBLOX](roblox.com). I used to heavily frequent the [Scripters](https://forum.roblox.com/Forum/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=33) forum and became very close with the community there. One of my pet peeves was that the forum website did not have a mobile version, which made browsing on-the-go fairly difficult and annoying. This is my solution to that problem.

### History

I began the project in early 2013. The code featured in this repository was mainly developed by me and then later [NXTBoy](https://www.roblox.com/users/921458/profile). Eventually, I became inactive on ROBLOX and the project was taken over by NXTBoy. The most recent version (now using a node.js backend) is linked below. The project is currently abandoned, but may be restarted in the future.


### Architecture

ROBLOX Mobile Forums uses [JQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/) to provide a mobile UI for the user and PHP on the backend to retrieve and parse forum data.
